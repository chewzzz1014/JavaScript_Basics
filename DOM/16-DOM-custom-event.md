## Custom Events

## Event Constructor
- Built-in event class form a hierarchy, similar to DOM element classes
- Root is the built-in Event class
- Create Event object:
- `event`: Event type. Eg, "click" or "my-event" (self-defined event type)
- `options`: Object w/ 2 optional properties
   - `bubbles: true/false`: False by default. If ture, event bubbles.
   - `cancelable: true/false`: False by default. If ture, the "default action" may be prevented
```
let event = new Event(type[, options]);
```

## dispatchEvent
- After event object is created, "run" in on element by calling `elem.dispatchEvent(event)`
- Then, handlers react on it as if it were a regular browser event.

```
<button id="elem" onclick="alert('Click');">Autoclick</button>

<script>
    let event = new Event("click");
    elem.dispatchEvent(event);
</script>
```

## Bubbling of Custom Event
- For code below, first alert "Hello from H1". Follow by displaying content in H1.
```
<h1 id="elem">Hello from the script!</h1>

<script>
   // listener for custom event 
  document.addEventListener("hello", function(event){         // (1)
      alert("Hello from " + event.target.tagName);  // Hello from H1
   });
   
   let event = new Event("hello", {bubbles: true});   // (2)
   elem.dispatchEvent(event);
</script>
```


## Classes for UI Events 
- Examples:
  - UIEvent
  - FocusEvent
  - MouseEvent
  - WheelEvent
  - KeyboardEvent
- Use them instead of `new Event`.
- Specify standard properties for that type of event (not for generic event. Only properties bubbles and cancelable work in Event constructor)

```
let event = new MouseEvent("click", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    clientX: 100,   // not in generic constructor
    clientY: 100  // not in generic constructor
  });
alert(event.clientX);   // 100
```

## Custom Event Class
- For our own, completely new events types like "hello" we should use new CustomEvent
- Technically CustomEvent is the same as Event, with one exception.
- `For CustomEvent, we can add additional property detail for any information that we want to pass with the event`

```
<h1 id="elem"> Hello for John!</h1>

<script>
    elem.addEventListener("hello", function(event){
        alert(event.detail.name);
    });
    
    elem.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("hello", {
        detail: {name: "John" }
    }));
</script>
```

## event.preventDefault()
- For new, custom events, there are definitely no default browser actions, but a code that dispatches such event may have its own plans what to do after triggering the event.
- By calling event.preventDefault(), an event handler may send a signal that those actions should be canceled.
- In that case the call to elem.dispatchEvent(event) returns false. And the code that dispatched it knows that it shouldnâ€™t continue.
